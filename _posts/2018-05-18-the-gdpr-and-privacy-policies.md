The GDPR, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation is about 
to get into action, so we decided to make our [privacy policy][1] explicit. 
It comes pretty much down to the following statement:

> Searsia does not collect or share personal information. 

At Searsia.org, we don't know who you are and there is no way to tie your 
activity on the site to you as a person. We do not store Cookies, nor other 
identifying information that is automatically sent by your web browser 
like your browser's User agent or your IP address. We do not use third 
party tracking software like Google Analytics. We do not allow third 
party Cookies to be stored when you use Searsia.org. 

A smilar, but more elaborate privacy policy is used by [Dr. Sheet Music][2].
The privacy policy of Dr. Sheet Music has an additional statement on
third party links. Search results in Searsia are generated by (other)
search engines in the federation, that will have separate, independent
privacy policies.  

> Our search results are generated by third party sites and contain third 
> party metadata and third party links. These third party sites have 
> separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no 
> responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these 
> linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site 
> and welcome any feedback about these sites. 

The privacy policies of Searsia and Dr. Sheet Music were inspired by
the policies of [Duckduckgo][3] and [Mastodon][4]. For more information
on the GDPR, check out the [GDPR Wikipedia page][5] and this 
[GDPR Compliance Checklist][6].
