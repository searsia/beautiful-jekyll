We presented Searsia at the 16th Annual Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop [DIR 2017][1] which
was hosted today by the The [Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision][2]. 
DIR 2017 aims to serve as an international platform (with a special focus on the Netherlands and Belgium)
for exchange and discussions on research & applications in the field of information retrieval as well as 
related fields.
